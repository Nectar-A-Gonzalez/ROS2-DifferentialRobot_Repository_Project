## DiffRobot_pkg
These packages are used to model a differential drive robot that communicates via ROS2 - Jazzy Distro.
The diffrobot_pkg includes the three nodes that are used to simulate the differential robots behavior.
The behavior is as follows:
The robot is given a velocity at which it should move, the encoders are to 


## How to build the package in your own workspace:
To build the package in the works space, first create your workspace folder dfd<br>

    mkdir -p ros2_ws/src dfdfdfdff
    dfdf

## Commands to test the pub/sub and service/client communications:
sdsdsdsd<br>
To simulate a commanding velocity input, dfdf<br>

    ros2 pub dfdfdf at -rate 10
    dfd
    klklkl

dfdfdf<br>

    df
    dfdf
