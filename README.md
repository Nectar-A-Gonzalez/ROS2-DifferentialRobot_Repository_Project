# DiffRobot_pkg
These packages are used to model a differential drive robot that communicates via ROS2 - Jazzy Distro.
The diffrobot_pkg includes the three nodes that are used to simulate the differential robots behavior.
The behavior is as follows:<br>
- The robot is given a velocity at which it should move, the encoders are simulated through a node, which takes that linear and angular velocity (Vx and wz) and translates it into the amount of ticks the encoder would read, if the velocity is applied for 1 (one) second and the encoder has a resolution of dfddfdfdf (variables defined in the robot_parameters.py, change for your use case).<br>
- Based on the amount of ticks read by the encoders and if they changed from the previous instance, the new position of the robot is calculated.<br>
dfdfd
- The encoders "read" the angular velocity of each wheel in terms of tics read per degree dfdfererer

#Communicates to what Explain the ros way of communicating or just the data processing aspect, I think only the logical part #IDEA
#And maybe give instrutions to how to see ros communication nodes relationships. #IDEA

## How to build the package in your own workspace:
To build the package in a workspace, you first need to create your workspace folder (if you don't already have one).<br>

### Create a workspace
To do that, in a terminal window write:

    mkdir -p ~/YOUR-WORKSPACE/src 
    cd ~/YOUR-WORKSPACE/src

This creates a folder with the name you decide for your workspace, and creates a folder called `src` inside of it.<br>
It then positions you inside the `src` folder, where your packages will be downloaded to; along with any source code you will use in your project.

### Download the packages
While inside the `src` folder, clone this repository to the folder:

    git clone https://github.com/Nectar-A-Gonzalez/ROS2-DifferentialRobot_Repository_Project

Here the diffrobot_pkg hold the dfdfdffdf code, while diffrobot_interfaces holds the necessary msg and srv templates for ROS2 communication.

### Resolve Dependencies
Before we can _build_ the workspace, we need to check if all the required package dependencies are installed.<br>
Go to the root of your workspace
    
    cd ~/YOUR-WORKSPACE/

Check the dependencies:

    rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro jazzy -y
    # Output: All required rosdeps installed sucessfully

### Build the workspace
Finally, we can build the workspace
From the root of your workspace, run:
    
    colcon build
    # Output:
    # Starting >>> ####
    # Finished <<< #### [###]
    # Summary: 2 package finished [###]

## How to source and run the package
To be able to access the executables that were just built, from our terminal, we need to source

    dfdfd
    dfdf

## Commands to test the pub/sub and service/client communications:
sdsdsdsd<br>

Verify 



To simulate a commanding velocity input, dfdf<br>

    ros2 pub dfdfdf at -rate 10
    dfd
    klklkl

dfdfdf<br>

    df
    dfdf

## Required Verification
1) Interfaces exist and are introspectable<br>

    ros2 interface show diffrobot_interfaces/msg/Wheelticks
    ros2 interface show diffrobot_interfaces/msg/Pose2DStamped
    ros2 interface show diffrobot_interfaces/srv/SetPose

2) Launch stack (encoder + kinematics)

    ros2 launch diffrobot_pkg diffrobot_launch.py

3) 

4) 

5) 

6) 

7)
