# Simulates wheel enconders by publishing cumulative left/right tick counts at 20 Hz based on commanded velocities (/cmd_vel)
# Tasks:
# - Publishes custom message WheelTicks.msg on /wheel_ticks at 20 Hz.
# - Includes builtin_interfaces/Time stamps
# - Interprets /cmd_vel (geometry_msgs/Twist) to update wheel tick increments. 
#   (You may generate your own /cmd_vel for testing; teleop is optional and not graded).
