# Subscribes to ticks and integrates standard diff-drive kinematics to publish a 2D pose (x, y, theta). 
# It also exposes a service to reset the pose to a user-specified state (e.g., when placing the robot at a known start pose).
# Task:
# - Subscribes to /wheel_ticks and computes pose (x, y, theta) using differential-drive kinematics.
# - Publishes custom messages Pose2DStamped.msg on /pose.
# - Offers service /reset_pose (type SetPose.srv) vto set the internal pose to given (x, y, theta).
